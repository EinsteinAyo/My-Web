										<h2><a href="#">2024 REWIND</a></h2>
										<p>Here's my 2024  Rewind.

											2024 has been a year a great year for me. 
											From defending my thesis on hydrodynamic flow of Arrheniously reacting micropolar nanofluids to helping shape the next generation of fearless African leaders at Wigwe University, 2024 marked a profound transformation in my academic journey.
											
											The year demonstrated that excellence in mathematics extends far beyond theoretical frameworks into tangible impact on society. Key milestones included:
											
											• Successfully completed B.Tech (Hons) in Pure and Applied Mathematics with First Class Honours from LAUTECH
											• Secured position as Teaching Assistant at Department of Mathematics and Data Science, Wigwe University
											• Featured in Nigerian Tribune newspaper print and online, sharing insights on achieving academic excellence
											• Completed Data Analyst role at Excelerate, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical applications
											• Received Top Ten Outstanding Personality Award from Junior Chamber International , JCI Nigeria.
											• Worked with different brands including TECNO. 
											
											Three posts that captured this journey of transformation:
											
											"Starting as Teaching Assistant at Wigwe University"
											On contributing to building fearless leaders who will facilitate unprecedented transformative change in Nigeria, Africa and beyond
											https://lnkd.in/d6RaQ3Uu
											
											"Nigerian Tribune Interview Feature"
											Speaking extensively about the academic journey to First Class Honours and inspiring others
											https://lnkd.in/dx-QTyh4
											
											"First Class Honours Achievement"
											Demonstrating that nothing is impossible and no mountain is insurmountable
											https://lnkd.in/dUvAAVvF
											
											Looking ahead to 2025: My focus remains on leveraging mathematical expertise to develop the next generation of African leaders through education , Technology and research, while continuing to advocate for academic excellence and transformative change in Nigeria's and Africa's educational landscape .
											
											To God be the glory for an extraordinary year of growth and impact. A very big thank you to everyone who has in one way or the other made this year a life-transforming one for me.

										<p>My joy knows no bounds on Monday being the 22nd of April, 2024 and my convocation day. It was a day that will forever be remembered. 

											My undergraduate academic odyssey on Ladoke Akintola University of Technology , LAUTECH Campus was the one that was backed-up with the grace of God, passion, relentless Spirit,commitment, and dedication towards academic excellence, capacity building, and service to humanity. It was a journey that was filled with pleasant and unpleasant memories and stories. It's gratifying that the Lord helped me to face my challenges and tough choices.
											
											Through out my 5-year stay on LAUTECH Soil as an advocate of academic excellence, I was committed to organizing tutorials for undergraduate students of the faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences and Faculty of Engineering. One of the things that do give me joy is to see students excel academically irrespective of their background. My love for politics and passion for a sane society where the rule of law will be respected , peace, love and Harmony will reign supreme, has always made me to be a crusader for good governance. This passion made me to participate fully in politics on and off LAUTECH Campus. I do very sincerely appreciate Ladokites, Members of Liberal Movement and everyone for the love shown when I contested for the position of the LAUTECH Students' Union President and during my tenure as the Attorney General of Liberal Movement, an Acadio-Socio-Political Organization. As a drug Free advocate, I was privilege to serve as the Director of Training and resourcesfullness of the LAUTECH Drug-Free Club and as a lover of Peace, I was appointed as the Chairman of the Nigerian Youth for Peace Initiatives, NYPI, Osun State Chapter during my undergraduate days. These and many other positions were held by me whilst I was on Campus. It was a journey worth embarking on.
											
											Combining these positions and activities with my academics was a herculean task that required extra efforts. It wasn't easy to balance everything. I bless God that despite my active involvement in a plethora of extracurricular activities aside my academics, I was still able to graduate with a FIRST CLASS HONOURS. Of a truth, it's a great feat for me. If you are reading this piece of mine, kindly be reminded that nothing is impossible and no mountain is insurmountable. I have believed very strongly that there's no excuse for failure and this belief was part of what made me to channel my energy towards achieving academic excellence. As a Student, it's important for you to know the kind of person you are, know what works for you, and that your primary assignment on Campus is your academics whilst other things remain secondary.

										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Def1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>On Monday February 26, 2024, at the Department of Pure And Applied Mathematics, LAUTECH, Ogbomoso, I was opportune to defend my Project titled HYDRODYNAMIC FLOW OF AN ARRHENIOUSLY REACTING MICROPOLAR NANOFLUIDS WITH THERMAL RADIATION OVER AN INCLINED PERMEABLE STRETCHING SURFACE. This was carried out in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Award of Degree of Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech (Hons) ) in Pure And Applied Mathematics. 

											My sincere appreciation goes to my Supervisor, Prof. A.W Ogunsola, a renowned Professor of Applied Mathematics and former Dean of Post Graduate School, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, LAUTECH, for the energy and time which he expended in supervising this work. I appreciate my level advisor, Dr. O.E Opaleye for the fatherly roles which he played in my Academic Journey in the last 5 years. I commend and appreciate all my distinguished Lecturers for their selfless Services and for the knowledge they were able to Impact.
